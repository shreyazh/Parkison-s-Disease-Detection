Architecture

The architecture of the Parkinson's Disease Detection Model can be broken down into several key components, each representing a stage in the machine learning pipeline. Hereâ€™s an outline of the architecture:

1. Data Layer
Data Source: The model uses a dataset stored in a CSV file (parkinsons.csv), which contains various features related to the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease.
Data Loading: The dataset is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame, making it accessible for analysis and processing.

2. Data Processing Layer
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Basic EDA is performed to understand the data structure, check for missing values, and analyze the distribution of the target variable (status), which indicates whether a person is healthy or has Parkinson's.
Feature Engineering: Features not relevant to model training, such as name, are removed. The target variable status is separated from the features for further processing.
Data Splitting: The dataset is divided into training and testing sets, with 80% used for training and 20% for testing.
Data Standardization: A StandardScaler is used to standardize the feature data, which helps in stabilizing the model's performance and ensuring consistency across different features.

3. Model Training Layer
Model Selection: A Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier with a linear kernel is chosen for classification, given its effectiveness in binary classification tasks.
Training: The SVM model is trained using the standardized training data. This step involves finding the optimal decision boundary that separates the two classes: healthy and Parkinson's positive.

4. Model Evaluation Layer
Accuracy Measurement: The model's accuracy is assessed on both training and testing sets using the accuracy_score metric. This helps evaluate how well the model has learned from the data and how it generalizes to unseen data.

5. Prediction Layer
Input Data Processing: New data for prediction is first converted into a format suitable for the model (NumPy array), reshaped, and then standardized using the same scaler that was applied to the training data.
Prediction: The model makes a prediction based on the input data, outputting whether the person is likely to have Parkinson's disease.
Output: Based on the model's prediction, a message is displayed indicating whether the input data suggests Parkinson's presence.

6. User Interface (Optional)
Command-Line Interface: Currently, the model runs as a script where predictions are made by entering input data directly in the code. However, this can be expanded into a simple CLI or integrated into a more comprehensive interface for broader usage.
