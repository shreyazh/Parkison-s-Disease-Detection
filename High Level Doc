High-Level Documentation for Parkinson's Disease Detection Model

1. Overview
This Python script is designed to detect Parkinson's disease using machine learning. The model leverages a Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm to classify individuals as either healthy or Parkinson's positive based on various medical features.

2. Key Components
Libraries Used:
numpy and pandas for data manipulation and analysis.
scikit-learn for model building, including modules for data splitting, preprocessing, and evaluation.
Data Source:
The script uses a dataset loaded from a CSV file named parkinsons.csv, containing features relevant to Parkinson’s disease.

3. Data Processing
Data Loading:
The CSV file is read into a Pandas DataFrame for easy manipulation and analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
The script performs basic EDA, including checking for missing values, displaying data types, and analyzing the distribution of the target variable (status), which indicates Parkinson's presence.
Feature Selection:
Irrelevant features (name) and the target variable (status) are separated from the dataset for further processing and modeling.

4. Data Preprocessing
Data Splitting:
The dataset is split into training and testing sets to enable model training and evaluation.
Standardization:
Feature data is standardized to ensure consistent scaling, which improves model performance.

5. Model Training
Algorithm Used:
A Support Vector Machine (SVM) with a linear kernel is selected for classification, as SVMs are effective for binary classification tasks.
Training:
The SVM model is trained on the standardized training dataset.

6. Model Evaluation
Performance Metrics:
The model's accuracy is evaluated on both the training and testing datasets, using accuracy_score to gauge its effectiveness in correctly predicting Parkinson’s presence.

7. Predictive System
Prediction Functionality:
The script includes a predictive system where input data can be transformed, standardized, and classified using the trained model.

Output:
The system outputs whether the input data suggests the presence of Parkinson's disease.
This high-level documentation provides an overview of the process and components involved in building a Parkinson's Disease Detection model, covering data loading, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction. This helps in understanding how the script functions and the role each section plays in achieving the goal of Parkinson's disease classification.
