The Parkinson's Disease Prediction Model is designed to help identify the likelihood of Parkinson's disease in individuals, supporting early detection and enabling timely intervention. This model uses data such as patient age, movement patterns, and speech characteristics, which are known to be indicators of Parkinson's. By analyzing this information, the model can predict the chances of someone having or developing the disease. The model is trained and tested to ensure accuracy, making it reliable for healthcare professionals. Once developed, it could be integrated into healthcare systems or apps, allowing clinicians to input patient data and receive a quick prediction. This tool could also be used with wearable devices, which track a patient’s movements and speech over time, providing continuous monitoring. While the model is promising, it faces challenges, such as ensuring data quality and avoiding any biases. Nevertheless, this prediction model has the potential to be a valuable resource in managing Parkinson’s disease, ultimately improving patient care.
